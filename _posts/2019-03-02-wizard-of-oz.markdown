The Wizard of Oz is a little funky cuz, um, the lion and the scarecrow and, um, Dorthy is, um, going back to her house and she's going on to the Wizard of Oz to try to go back home. She's trying to go back home, and, um, that's all I'm gonna talk about today!

Dorothy keeps stomping her feet like this: \*stomping feet*.

The scarecrow needs a brain because he's a real dingus!

## My Favorite Song
The one where, like, _"ding dong the wicked witch is dead!"_

# See ya next time!
